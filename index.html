            <p>
            I bootstrapped this page after having a mind blowing meal at <a href="http://www.psistaria.com/"> Psistaria Greek Taverna</a>.
            </p>
            For a while now, I've been meaning to have some outlet to document my experiences.
            Whether it be writing about my food adventures, or just sharing things on my mind,
            this humble little site will foster it all.
            <p>
            Some might call this amazingly aesthetic site minimalist. <br>
            I would beg to differ. <br>
            I'm just lazy.
            </p>
            <p>
            Buuut... adding extra Javascript and/or nicer formatting would just bloat the site anyway right? :^)

                <p>
                Just a simple kid from the great city of East Brunswick, New Jersey.
                I love food, cooking, baking, nice weather, good music, video games, traveling/exploring, and more stuff probably.
                </p>
                <p>
                I've been at <strong class="nu">Northwestern University </strong> 
                since September 2016, studying Computer Science in Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences.
                I will be done with classes by June 2019.
                </p>
            <h3 class="heading">next</h3>
                <p>
                I'll be in the bay for six months starting June, doing two software engineering internships.
                I'll hopefully have a better idea of what I want to do for the long run afterwards. 
                <br><br>
